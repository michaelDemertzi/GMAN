				In 2010, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Citizens United that corporations are people. This decision allowed for unlimited corporate and union spending in the political process. Fast forward 5 years into the future – present day America. During this fast forward, the world saw the rise of the Occupy movement, where folks from all over the world started to protest social and economic inequality. These movements drew more attention to the way money and politics are so intimately related. As such, many individuals have grown skeptical about their individual influence in today’s system.

				<p>
				Within this application, we seek to provide a new outlook on the role that money plays in influencing the legislative process. More specifically we give you, the user, the ability to examine the role of money in politics. Feel free to form your own opinions, and test your own conjectures using our analytic.
